## Learning Strategy

### Phase 1: LLM Fundamentals (January 2026)
- Complete LLM Engineering course with Ed Donner
- Quick MCP crash course for protocol understanding
- Build foundation for advanced topics

### Phase 2: Production AI Systems (February - March 2026)
- Deploy Gen AI and Agentic AI at scale
- AWS ML Engineer Associate preparation and certification
- Focus on practical deployment patterns

### Phase 3: Kubernetes Mastery (April - May 2026)
- CKA certification - cluster administration and management
- CKAD certification - application development and deployment
- 6 weeks of intensive hands-on practice
- Critical for orchestrating ML workloads at scale

### Phase 4: AWS ML Specialization (May - June 2026)
- AWS ML Specialty certification
- Deep dive into AWS ML services
- Advanced ML engineering patterns
- Target completion: June 15

### Phase 5: Community Learning & Advanced Topics (June 2026+)
- Join LLM Zoomcamp cohort (DataTalks.Club)
- Participate in community projects
- Network with other LLM engineers

### Ongoing: Stay Current
- Monitor DataTalks.Club for MLOps Zoomcamp
- Engage with DataTalks.Club community on Slack
- Consider Data Engineering Associate cert as complementary skill


## Notes

- **Practice Exam Strategy**: For AWS certifications, take practice exams first to identify knowledge gaps and guide focused study
- **Certification Priority**: ML Engineer Associate → CKA/CKAD → ML Specialty → Data Engineer Associate (as time permits)
- **Kubernetes Strategy**: Complete both CKA and CKAD over 6 weeks (April-May); I already hold CKA and CKAD certifications which will accelerate CKAD preparation and allow deeper focus on application development patterns
- **Community Engagement**: Actively find and participate in local meetups in the Dallas area for meetups, engage in DataTalks.Club Slack for networking and learning opportunities, announce achievements on Linkedin
- **Action Items**:
  - [ ] Find additional practice exams for AWS ML Engineer Associate
  - [ ] Research quality practice exams for AWS ML Specialty
  - [ ] Set calendar reminders for DataTalks.Club cohort registrations
  - [ ] Join DataTalks.Club Slack community
  - [ ] Find and attend local AI related meetups
  - [ ] Schedule CKA and CKAD exam dates for mid-May (target: May 15)
